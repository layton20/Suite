# Suite
An ASP.NET Core App, integrating the most random tech to showcase our ability and passion for development. Please, snoop around ;)

From pages integrating with random APIs, to pages using Stripe payment, to using services like Azure ComsmoDB, Blob, AI to MongoDB, caching with Redis, and a whole bunch of miscellaneous things! We will work on this website weekly, find some new tech, research and integrate it into our website for you to have a peek at. Our end-goal is to gain more experience and knowledge working with tech outside of our comfort zone and what we're used to on our usual work-job, but to also demonstrate our commitment and drive to learning new tech. If lucky, we may even be able to suggest some of the things we've worked on into our work when the situation arises. We're also always looking to improve our codebase for maintainability, scalability and readability, so if you find our code is not up to your standard, don't worry, we'll get there soon. Please, take your time with us :)
